# define a list of configuration variables that drive the behavior of the container deployment scripts 

##### Container Configuration Variables: #####

	# determine current folder path (core/scripts/config)
	CONFIG_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"

	# determine where the designated container subfolder in the local filesystem is (/core/scripts/build):
	BUILD_PATH="${CONFIG_DIR}/../../build"
	
	# define the path to the /core repository subfolder
	CORE_PATH="${CONFIG_DIR}/../.."

	# define the path to the /core/config repository subfolder
	CORE_CONFIG_PATH="${CONFIG_DIR}/../../config"

	# define the path to the root repository folder
	ROOT_PATH="${CONFIG_DIR}/../../.."

	# define the path to the /projects folder
	PROJECTS_PATH="${CONFIG_DIR}/../../../projects"

	# define the path to the logs folder
	LOGS_PATH="${ROOT_PATH}/logs"

##### Container Project Configuration Variables: #####

	# define a variable to store the name of the configuration data variable that is passed via STDIN that contains secret values
	SECRET_DATA_VAR_NAME="SECRET_DATA"

	# define a variable to store the name of the associative array containing the secret names and corresponding bash variables
	SECRET_MAPPING_VAR_NAME="SECRET_MAPPING_ARR"

##### Database Configuration: #####

	# container database host
	DBHOST=code-db

	# container database port
	DBPORT=1521

	# container database service name
	DBSERVICENAME=FREEPDB1


##### Project Linear Dependency Configuration: #####

# These variables define arrays that are used to specify custom information about each of the projects that have linear dependencies so the corresponding actions can be executed in the correct order.

	# define the array to track the linear fork dependencies, the first element is the direct CODE fork and every subsequent element is the fork of the previous element. This corresponds to the folder name of the project in the /projects folder
	PROJECT_LINEAR_DEPENDENCIES=()

	# define the database scripts mapping using the pipe character as a delimiter, they will be executed in the order the elements are added to the array
	# The elements should contain encoded values with the "|" character as the delimiter: sql path (within container)|sql script file|User Secret Name|Password Secret Name|Script Password Secrets (this can be one or more optional pipe-delimited secret names when a password is injected into the script - examples include a CREATE USER command) 
	DB_SCRIPTS_MAP=()

	# define the array of non-sensitive environment variable names that are exported for use in the container
	CUSTOM_ENV_VARS=()

	# define the array of compose files that are used by the individual projects, they will be included in the order the elements are added to the array
	COMPOSE_FILES=()

##### Container Secret Configuration Variables: #####

	# define an associative array with the secret name as the array element and the bash variable name as the array value, the array element values should match the variable names in secrets.sh
	declare -gA SECRET_MAPPING_ARR=(
		["oracle_pwd"]="ORACLE_PWD"
		["oracle_admin_user"]="ORACLE_ADMIN_USER"
	)
